## Path finding is a misnomer
This repository documents our experiments with bot programming. We experiment with all topics from the mundane path finding to the abstract state management.

## Reference material
We refer to a lot of existing work including blogs, videos, research papers and books. A good reference ideally opens up a new avenue for experimenting.

### General Principles
